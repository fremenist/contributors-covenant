# Contributors' Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers aim to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment
include:

* Writing great code
* Not being a dick

## Our Responsibilities

Within the bounds of this project, we pledge to:

* write great code
* not be dicks

## Your Responsibilities

Within the bounds of this project, we hope that you pledge to:

* write great code
* not be a dick

## Scope

Unless you are specifically representing this project in a defined public capacity, 
the scope of this Code of Conduct begins and ends with this project.  We leave our 
politics at the door, and we hope you choose to do likewise.

## Enforcement

The maintainers and custodians of this project reserve the right to call you a 
very naughty boy (or girl, or whatever), and to ask you to stop being quite so 
much of a dick or to at least explain your behaviour.  If you persist in being 
a dick, then we might fall out.
